Line graphs are used to display quantitative values over a continuous interval or time period. A line graph is often used to show trends and analyze how data changed over time, but time does not have to be one of the variables. How do you read this line graph? Use the next and back buttons to explore and learn. ', 'Annual means every year, and here, rate refers to the percentage of growth in the population from year to year. Percentage means the number in each 100, so if there were 100 people one year, and the next year there were 105 people, that would be 5% growth rate. If, instead of 105, there were 150 people by the second year, that would be a 50% growth rate – a much faster rate of growth! Based on the title, you can expect this graph to show the yearly rate of growth for the entire population since 1950. The end date is 2100 because the creators are making an informed guess about what the growth rate will be in the future, based on population trends.', 'This graph was created from two sources. The observations shown by the red line come from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the projections, or informed guesses about the future, come from the United Nations Population Division. ', 'The x-axis shows the years over which population growth rate and projected population growth rate is being tracked. You can see by the label under the x-axis where the projected number begins, and what formula they are using to determine the projection. Notice that the intervals, the time difference between years labeled on the axis, is irregular. There are mostly 20-year intervals, but a few 10-year intervals. The creator of the data visualization probably made this choice based on the first and last years of data they were using as well important points they wanted to highlight (for example, the peak of the world population growth rate around 1960). It’s important to pay attention to the labels on an axis and ask yourself questions about how the creator’s choices may have altered the story being told.', 'The y-axis shows the percentage of annual population growth. Each value is a percentage, so a value of 0.20 means two-tenths of a percent growth rate. The number 2.2, at the top of the y-axis, is 2.2 percent growth rate. That number may seem small, but consider there were 3 billion people in the world in 1960, and 2.2% of 3 billion is 66 million people!', 'The line shows changes in the world population growth rate over time. It allows you to spot trends in the growth rate. For example, you can see that the growth has been trending downward since about 1963. Prior to that it had been trending upward, other than during a brief period of time between 1958 and 1961. The graph creator also added text to help explain both important points and anomalies (points where the data shows something different than normal or expected). The decline in the population growth rate caused by the Great Leap Forward between 1958 and 1961  is a good example of how data can tell a story, or raise questions for additional research. For example, you might now ask, “What was the Great Leap Forward and why did it lead to the deaths of so many people?”', ]; let id_table = [ 'grid', 'title', 'source', 'xAxis', 'yAxis', 'graph', ]; let index = 0; function nextClick(){ ++index; if(index > comp_title.length-1){ for(var i = 1; i < comp_title.length; ++i){ document.getElementById(id_table[i]).style.visibility = "inherit"; } document.getElementById(id_table[0]).style.visibility = "hidden"; index = 0 }else{ document.getElementById(id_table[index-1]).style.visibility = "visible"; } console.log(index); document.getElementById(id_table[index]).style.visibility = "hidden"; document.getElementById("comp-title").innerHTML = comp_title[index]; document.getElementById("comp-info").innerHTML = comp_content[index]; } function backClick(){ --index; if(index < 0){ index = comp_title.length-1; document.getElementById(id_table[0]).style.visibility = "visible"; }else{ document.getElementById(id_table[index+1]).style.visibility = "visible"; } if(index === 0){ for(var i = 1; i < comp_title.length; ++i){ document.getElementById(id_table[i]).style.visibility = "inherit"; } document.getElementById(id_table[0]).style.visibility = "hidden"; } console.log(index); document.getElementById(id_table[index]).style.visibility = "hidden"; document.getElementById("comp-title").innerHTML = comp_title[index]; document.getElementById("comp-info").innerHTML = comp_content[index]; } </script> </body></html>
